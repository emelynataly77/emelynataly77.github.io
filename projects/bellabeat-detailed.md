## üßº Data Cleaning in Excel <a name="excel-cleaning"></a>

I began with raw `.csv` files from the FitBit Fitness Tracker dataset. In Excel, I:

- Removed null and duplicate values  
- Renamed columns to consistent `snake_case` format  
- Converted `datetime` columns for compatibility  
- Manually inspected entries for anomalies

This prepared the data for SQL processing.

## üßÆ SQL Queries in BigQuery <a name="sql-queries"></a>

The cleaned Excel data was uploaded to BigQuery for querying. Example queries below:

```sql
-- Total steps per user per day
SELECT Id, activityDate, SUM(TotalSteps) AS daily_steps
FROM daily_activity
GROUP BY Id, activityDate
ORDER BY activityDate;

-- Average calories burned
SELECT Id, AVG(Calories) AS avg_calories
FROM daily_activity
GROUP BY Id;
