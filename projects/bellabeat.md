# üîç Project Overview <a id="project-overview"></a>

This is the Google Data Analytics capstone project I chose to persue. This case study analyzes smart device fitness data to uncover insights for Bellabeat ‚Äî a women‚Äôs wellness company.
The goal was to explore how consumers use fitness devices and provide actionable recommendations to Bellabeat‚Äôs marketing strategy. 
I myself am very passionate about heath and wellness and reaching ones fitness goals and deeply enjoyed working on this subject matter.

### The Data <a id="the-data"></a>

The following .csv files were used during data cleaning and analysis:

<div style="display: flex; gap: 40px;">

  <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><span style="color:gray;">'dailyActivity_merged.csv'</span></li>

After doing som research on the data ive learned that the data was collected in 2016 and represents 33 indivduals who decided to participate in having the data anlyzed. 2016 is not very recent, health data from previous years can be useful but for the purpose of planningmarketing strategies for a current market it seems more likely the company should use data that represents their current customer clientail. Moreover, there are no identities associated with the participants as everything has been left anonoymous. The data itself is not very reliable or consistent. Futhermore, many of the participants did not log data for many days, many datasets lack the 33 participants analyzed in this case study. Additionally, the way in which the participants were chosen is not shared meaning we do not know if these participants were chosen randomly, whether they were part a more active customer group, or whther they were part of a lesser active group. Because of the lack of consistent information and no information on thebackground of many of the participants the data seems to be unreliable. 

It is unknown how the data itself was collected. However, the data originated from a third party. Lastly, I owuld like to make it clear that this data was provided by th authors of the capstone project and the dataset itself was downloaded from a Kaggle user, any other information on how this user obained the data is not made clear. In my opinion the data quality is not great alas, I will continue to process and analyze, for the purpose of completing the case study. Onward!

# üßπ Excel Cleaning <a id="excel-cleaning"></a>

I began with raw .csv files from the FitBit Fitness Tracker dataset. 
I completed basic cleaning including: 
  
- Removed nulls, blanks, and duplicate values   
- Converted `datetime` columns for compatibility into SQL 
- Used =COUNTA(UNIQUE()) function to compare user ID counts across datasets

<br>

The table below represents a summary of the cleaning completed on Excel:

<br>


Many datasets were too large to process on excel and even too large to properly process on either Rstudio and BigQuery.  Additionally, there were a few datasets that were too inconsistent and incomplete to accurately deduct any type of analysis. Also, there were a ferw datasets that contained repetitive data and overlapped with other existing datasets. For example, dailyCalories_merged, dailyIntensities_merged adn dailySteps_merged overlapped with dailyActivity_merged which included all the information on those three files and then some. Therefore those three were dropped and only dailyActivity_merged would continue to be analyzed. Any datasets that met the criteria describes above were dropped from further exploration (red). Datasets that were eligible for proper processing were uplodaed into BigQueary and further processed

  </div>

</div>















 After cleaning the proper data on excel, the files were saved without the unnecessary "merged" title. For example 'dailyCalories_merged' was changed to 'dailyCalories' and so on.
I decided that the data was too intolerabel to continue processing on Excel other than the basic cleaning mentioned above. So I decided to move over to the BigQueary platform and continue analyzing the necessary data. Overall, Excel provided a quick and straightforward way to clean the data during the early stages of processing. 


NOTE: Moving forward I will be processing the data by grouping similiar datasets by their datatype (e.g., daily/sleep, hourly) to help keep things organized and straightforward.

# üßÆ SQL Queries in BigQuery <a id="sql-queries"></a>

### Hourly Data <a id="hourly-data-sql"></a>

- <span style="color:gray;">'hourlyCalories.csv'</span>
- <span style="color:gray;">'hourlySteps.csv'</span>
- <span style="color:gray;">'hourlyIntensities.csv'</span>
  

The hourly datasets above were uploaded into BigQuery. I checked if a smooth upload was successful by using a few quick queries
<br>



Successful Upload Check: 

<details>
<summary>Show SQL Query</summary>

<pre><code class="language-sql">
-- Row count
SELECT COUNT (*) as row_count
FROM `bellabeat-461300.fittracker.hourly_calories` 
--Check for NULL values in columns
SELECT
  COUNTIF(Id IS NULL) AS id_nulls,
  COUNTIF(ActivityHour IS NULL) AS activity_hour_nulls,
  COUNTIF(Calories IS NULL) AS calories_nulls
FROM `bellabeat-461300.fittracker.hourly_calories`;
-- Preview Data
SELECT *
FROM `bellabeat-461300.fittracker.hourly_calories` LIMIT 10;
</code></pre>

</details>



<br> 
I completed the above three querires for all of the hourly data sets after uploading. After I felt comfprtable that the data was ploaded correctly I decided to combine the three hourly datasets. The hourly datasets contained overlapping data that was repetiative and unncescesary. I combined them into one data set so that they owuld beocme easier to handle and analyze later on. 
<br>



I used the following query to merge the hourly datasets:

<details>
<summary>Show SQL Query</summary>

<pre><code class="language-sql">
-- Merge hourly calories, steps, and intensities datasets using LEFT JOIN on Id and ActivityHour
SELECT A.Id, A.ActivityHour AS activity_hour, A.Calories, C.StepTotal AS step_total, I.TotalIntensity AS total_intensity, I.AverageIntensity AS average_intensity,
FROM `bellabeat-461300.fittracker.hourly_calories` A
LEFT JOIN `bellabeat-461300.fittracker.hourly_steps` C
ON
A.Id=C.Id
AND A.ActivityHour=C.ActivityHour
LEFT JOIN `bellabeat-461300.fittracker.hourly_intensities` I
ON
A.Id=I.Id
AND A.ActivityHour=C.ActivityHour
</code></pre>

</details>



<br>
The resulting data file: <span style="color:gray;">'hourlyMerged.csv'</span> can now be uploaded into RStudio to be further processed. 

NOTE: I reintroduced the 'merged' wordage here because that is more representative of the data (which we merged). 


### Daily/Sleep Data <a id="daily-sleep-data-sql"></a>

- <span style="color:gray;">'dailyActivity.csv'</span>
- <span style="color:gray;">'dailyCalories.csv'</span>
- <span style="color:gray;">'dailyIntensities.csv'</span>
- <span style="color:gray;">'dailySteps.csv'</span>
- <span style="color:gray;">'sleepDay.csv'</span>


The daily datasets abover were uploaded into BigQuery. Again i quickly checked if the data was uploaded accurately using a few wuick queries.
<br>

</code></pre>

</details>



<br> 
I completed the above querys for the dailyactivity dataset as well. Next, I decided to combine the dailyactivity and sleepday datasets as they had some correspondonding data. It was also cleaner to just develop two datasets (hourly and daily/sleep) so sleepday was also added to the daily dataset. 
<br>



I used the following query to merge the dailyactivity sleepday datasets:

<details>
<summary>Show SQL Query</summary>

<pre><code class="language-sql">

  (VeryActiveMinutes + FairlyActiveMinutes) AS HeavyActiveMinutes,
  (LightlyActiveMinutes + SedentaryMinutes) AS LightActiveMinutes,
  Calories,
  sleep.TotalSleepRecords,
  sleep.TotalMinutesAsleep,
  sleep.TotalTimeInBed
FROM `bellabeat-461300.fittracker.daily_activity` AS activity
INNER JOIN `bellabeat-461300.fittracker.sleep_day` AS sleep
  ON activity.Id = sleep.Id
  AND activity.ActivityDATE = sleep.SleepDay;
</code></pre>

</details>



<br>
The resulting merged data file: <span style="color:gray;">'dailyMerged.csv'</span> can now be uploaded into RStudio to be further processed. 

NOTE: I reintroduced the 'merged' wordage here because that is more representative of the data (which we merged).

### Hourly Data <a id="hourly-data-r"></a>
- <span style="color:gray;">'hourlyMerged.csv'</span>

First I loaded the packages that I will be needing for the hourly and daily data analysis in RStudio. I will be using tidyverse and lubridate. Next, I uploaded both my hourly_merged datasets.

After confirming the file was uploaded correctly, I began analyzing the data from both a day-of-the-week and time-of-day perspective. To do this, I first split the `activity_hour column` (which contains combined date and time values) into two separate columns: `activityDate` for the date and `time` for the time. I then converted the `activityDate` column into proper Date format and used it to create a new weekday column that indicates the day of the week. Similarly, I converted the time column and used it to categorize each entry into time-of-day segments‚ÄîNight, Morning, Afternoon, and Evening‚Äîbased on the hour of the activity. You can see the following code below.

Shockingly, there didnt seem to be any substantial linear correlation between intensity and steps taken or intensity and calories burned. Since we split the data into time of day I wanted to also check at which points of the day individuals were being more or less active. I would assume participants would be more active during the morning or evening times considering, work schedules and common physical activity timeslots. However, this assumption dos not account for the weekends.  I wrote up the following two code blocks to analyze time of day activity throught the week (SUN-SAT).

We can see by looking at the summaries that Night has a really low step count(~21) compared to the oter times of day. This makes sense as most people are asleep during the "Night" time-frame. 
Moreover, let go ahead and calculate only for the average stps and calories as thats how we will tell more or less how activity levels based on time of day.

 I was a little surprised to find that most users were significantly more active during the afternoon and not the morning and evening. This could be notworthy as to who bellabeats targer customers could be (people who do not usually work a 9-5?) Moreover, that would of course require more data thtan we currently have. Just somthing to keep in mind for future research/refernce. The evening and morning being relatively the same was unsurprising. The sama ecan be said for nightime being the the time users were the least active.

People who sleep more tend to have fewer non-active minutes during the day (a stronger relationship)
They also tend to have slightly fewer active minutes, but this relationship is weak....
The negative correlations suggest more sleep might be associated with more overall movement or less sedentary time, especially the stronger relationship with non-active minutes.
The graph above suggests that people who sleep more may be more active during the day. The low p value (2.2e-16) confirms statistical significance. I wanted to look further into the day by day breakdown of the data between sleep adn non-activity. In the code block below I filter the data for each day of the week and generate summary statistics for the filtered datasets.
Again i want to break the data into time frames and days of the week to grasp when users are getting the most out of device usage or the least usage. Simple summaries of the data could help up pinpoint genreal calculations of the columns.

Looking at the graohs it becomes more clear that the beginning of the work week (mon/tues) tend to be higher on all the generated graphs along wiht saturday. Fridays tend to be the lowest on most of the graphs suggesting a more relaxed Fiday in terms of the data. 

# üí° Key Insights <a id="key-insights"></a>
- Early on during the data research phase I discovered gaps and inconsitensies that point to flawed or inadequate data recording/gathering. Meaning, bellabeat needs to work on properly gathering reliable/substantial data from their users. Or they need to find a way to push their customers into logging data more consistently. 
- There are specific days of the week in which customers are less likely to be more active. Users are more active during the week. excluding friday which is the least active reported day. 
- Encourage other aspects of health more readily such as, weight and nutritional intake through the fitbit.
- Users are more active during the week
- Step counts are generally lower than the recommneded average, encourage walking or set walking goals
- Sleep is below average recom?
