### The Data <a id="the-data"></a>

The FitBit Fitness Tracker dataset, provided by Kaggle user Mobius, serves as the basis for this case study. It includes the 18 .csv files that I will use for procsessing, cleaning and analyzing. 

<div style="display: flex; gap: 40px;">

  <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><span style="color:gray;">'dailyActivity_merged.csv'</span></li>
    <li><span style="color:gray;">'dailyCalories_merged.csv'</span></li>
    <li><span style="color:gray;">'dailyIntensities_merged.csv'</span></li>
    <li><span style="color:gray;">'dailySteps_merged.csv'</span></li>
    <li><span style="color:gray;">'heartrate_seconds_merged.csv'</span></li>
    <li><span style="color:gray;">'hourlyCalories_merged.csv'</span></li>
  </ul>

  <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><span style="color:gray;">'hourlyIntensities_merged.csv'</span></li>
    <li><span style="color:gray;">'hourlySteps_merged.csv'</span></li>
    <li><span style="color:gray;">'minuteCaloriesNarrow_merged.csv'</span></li>
    <li><span style="color:gray;">'minuteCaloriesWide_merged.csv'</span></li>
    <li><span style="color:gray;">'minuteIntensitiesNarrow_merged.csv'</span></li>
    <li><span style="color:gray;">'minuteIntensitiesWide_merged.csv'</span></li>
  </ul>

  <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li><span style="color:gray;">'minuteMETsNarrow_merged.csv'</span></li>
    <li><span style="color:gray;">'minuteSleep_merged.csv'</span></li>
    <li><span style="color:gray;">'minuteStepsNarrow_merged.csv'</span></li>
    <li><span style="color:gray;">'minuteStepsWide_merged.csv'</span></li>
    <li><span style="color:gray;">'sleepDay_merged.csv'</span></li>
    <li><span style="color:gray;">'weightLogInfo_merged.csv'</span></li>
  </ul>

</div>

After doing some research on the data, I found that it was collected in 2016 and includes data from 33 Bellabeat users who voluntarily agreed to share their information for analysis. Although historical health data can provide helpful insights, using data from 2016 might not be the best way to guide marketing strategies for today‚Äôs consumers. It would seem more effective to analyze data that accurately reflects Bellabeat's current customer base. Additionally, all of the data has been anonymized, and it remains unclear how these users were selected. We don't know if these users represent a randomly selected group or if they met some other criteria. The lack of available information, combined with the small sample size, makes it hard to determine how representative and reliable the data actually is. The data is also inconsistent ‚Äî many datasets include fewer than 33 users, and entire days of data are absent. The data itself is sourced from a third party and made available on Kaggle by the user Mobius. Overall, the data quality could use some improvement. That said, I will continue with the analysis for the sake of this case study ‚Äî onward!

# üßπ Excel Cleaning <a id="excel-cleaning"></a>

I began with 18 raw .csv files from the FitBit Fitness Tracker dataset. 
I completed basic data cleaning including: 
  
- Removing nulls, blanks, and duplicate values   
- Converting datetime columns for compatibility into SQL/R 
- Using =COUNTA(UNIQUE()) function to compare user ID counts across datasets 

The table below represents a summary of the cleaning completed on Excel: 



<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 40px; flex-wrap: wrap; text-align: center; margin-top: 20px;">

  <!-- Excel Table Image -->

  </div>

</div>





<br>

Many of the original datasets were too large to be processed efficiently using Excel, RStudio, or even BigQuery. In addition, several datasets were too inconsistent or incomplete to support any meaningful analysis. Some also contained repetitive or overlapping information. For instance, dailyCalories_merged, dailyIntensities_merged, and dailySteps_merged all overlapped with dailyActivity_merged, which already included the same data and more. As a result, those files were removed, and only dailyActivity_merged was kept for further analysis.

Any datasets that were incomplete, redundant, or too large to process were excluded from further exploration (as shown on the right). The remaining datasets (listed on the left) were uploaded into BigQuery for continued analysis.

      <li><span style="color:gray;">'weightLogInfo_merged.csv'</span></li>
    </ul>
  </div>

</div>

After completing the initial cleaning in Excel‚Äîsuch as removing nulls and duplicates‚Äîthe files were renamed to drop the unnecessary 'merged' label (e.g., 'dailyCalories_merged' became 'dailyCalories,' as shown above). While Excel worked well for early-stage cleanup, the data soon became too large and difficult to manage efficiently. So, I moved everything over to BigQuery, where working with the datasets was much more manageable.


NOTE: Moving forward I will be processing the data by grouping similiar datasets by their datatype (e.g., daily/sleep, hourly) to help keep things organized and straightforward.

# üßÆ SQL Queries in BigQuery <a id="sql-queries"></a>

### Hourly Data <a id="hourly-data-sql"></a>

- <span style="color:gray;">'hourlyCalories.csv'</span>
- <span style="color:gray;">'hourlySteps.csv'</span>
- <span style="color:gray;">'hourlyIntensities.csv'</span>
  

After uploading the hourly datasets to BigQuery, I ran a few quick queries to ensure the data had been imported correctly. 
<br>



Upload Check: 

<details>
<summary>Show SQL Query</summary>

<pre><code class="language-sql">
-- Row count
SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count
FROM `bellabeat-461300.fittracker.hourly_calories`;

-- Check for NULL values in columns
SELECT
  COUNTIF(Id IS NULL) AS id_nulls,
  COUNTIF(ActivityHour IS NULL) AS activity_hour_nulls,
  COUNTIF(Calories IS NULL) AS calories_nulls
FROM `bellabeat-461300.fittracker.hourly_calories`;

-- Preview Data
SELECT *
FROM `bellabeat-461300.fittracker.hourly_calories`
LIMIT 10;
</code></pre>

</details>



<br> 
After running the three queries on each of the hourly datasets, I was confident everything uploaded correctly. Because the datasets shared some common data (like ID and activity hour) but each also contained different information (such as calories, steps, and intensities), I combined them into one comprehensive hourly dataset.
<br>



I used the following query to merge the hourly datasets:

<details>
<summary>Show SQL Query</summary>

<pre><code class="language-sql">
-- Merge hourly calories, steps, and intensities datasets using LEFT JOIN on Id and ActivityHour
SELECT 
  A.Id, 
  A.ActivityHour AS activity_hour, 
  A.Calories, 
  C.StepTotal AS step_total, 
  I.TotalIntensity AS total_intensity, 
  I.AverageIntensity AS average_intensity
FROM `bellabeat-461300.fittracker.hourly_calories` A
LEFT JOIN `bellabeat-461300.fittracker.hourly_steps` C
  ON A.Id = C.Id AND A.ActivityHour = C.ActivityHour
LEFT JOIN `bellabeat-461300.fittracker.hourly_intensities` I
  ON A.Id = I.Id AND A.ActivityHour = C.ActivityHour;
</code></pre>

</details>



<br>
The resulting data file: <span style="color:gray;">'hourlyMerged.csv'</span> can now be uploaded into RStudio to be further processed. 

NOTE: I reintroduced the 'merged' wordage here because that is more representative of the data now (which we just merged). 


### Daily/Sleep Data <a id="daily-sleep-data-sql"></a>

- <span style="color:gray;">'dailyActivity.csv'</span>
- <span style="color:gray;">'dailyCalories.csv'</span>
- <span style="color:gray;">'dailyIntensities.csv'</span>
- <span style="color:gray;">'dailySteps.csv'</span>
- <span style="color:gray;">'sleepDay.csv'</span>


The daily and sleep datasets above were uploaded into BigQuery. Once again, I ran a few quik checks to ensure everything was imported correctly. 
<br>


 
Upload check:

<details>
<summary>Show SQL Query</summary>

<pre><code class="language-sql">

  COUNTIF(Id IS NULL) AS id_nulls,
  COUNTIF(SleepDay IS NULL) AS sleep_day_nulls,
  COUNTIF(TotalSleepRecords IS NULL) AS total_sleep_records_nulls,
  COUNTIF(TotalMinutesAsleep IS NULL) AS total_minutes_asleep_nulls,
  COUNTIF(TotalTimeInBed IS NULL) AS total_time_in_bed_nulls

-- Preview Data
SELECT *
FROM `bellabeat-461300.fittracker.sleep_day`
LIMIT 10;
</code></pre>

</details>



<br> 
I ran the same set of queries on the dailyActivity dataset as well.  Next, I decided to combine the dailyactivity and sleepday datasets as they had some correspondonding data. Bringing the two datasets together also made things simpler, letting me focus on just two main datasets: hourly and daily/sleep. 
<br>



Merging dailyactivity and sleepday datasets:

<details>
<summary>Show SQL Query</summary>

<pre><code class="language-sql">
-- Join daily activity and sleep datasets using INNER JOIN on Id and matching date fields

  (LightActiveDistance + SedentaryActiveDistance) AS ShorterDistance,
  (VeryActiveMinutes + FairlyActiveMinutes) AS HeavyActiveMinutes,
  (LightlyActiveMinutes + SedentaryMinutes) AS LightActiveMinutes,
  Calories,
  sleep.TotalSleepRecords,
  sleep.TotalMinutesAsleep,
  sleep.TotalTimeInBed
FROM `bellabeat-461300.fittracker.daily_activity` AS activity
INNER JOIN `bellabeat-461300.fittracker.sleep_day` AS sleep
  ON activity.Id = sleep.Id
  AND activity.ActivityDate = sleep.SleepDay;
</code></pre>

</details>



<br>
The resulting merged data file: <span style="color:gray;">'dailyMerged.csv'</span> can now be uploaded into RStudio to be further processed. 

NOTE: I reintroduced the 'merged' wordage here because that is more representative of the data (which we merged).

First I loaded the packages that I will be needing for the hourly and daily data analysis in RStudio. Next, I uploaded my hourlyMerged dataset.

After confirming the file uploaded correctly, I decided to analyze the data by both day of the week and time of day. This allowed me to examine user activity across a Monday‚ÄìSunday timeframe and throughout different parts of the day. To do this, I first split the activity_hour column‚Äîwhich contains both date and time values‚Äîinto two separate columns: activityDate for the date and time for the time. I then converted the activityDate column into a proper date format and used it to create a new column indicating the day of the week. Similarly, I converted the time column and categorized each entry into one of four time-of-day segments‚ÄîNight, Morning, Afternoon, and Evening‚Äîbased on the activity hour. You can see the following code below.

Interestingly, there didn‚Äôt appear to be any strong or meaningful linear correlation between intensity and steps taken, or between intensity and calories burned. On the other hand, the number of steps has a strong positive linear correlation with calories burned. This makes sense, as generally the more steps you take the more calories you're likely to burn. Since the dataset was already grouped by time of day, I wanted to take a closer look at when participants were most or least active. I first assumed that activity levels would peak in the morning and evening‚Äîtimes because that usually aligns with common workout windows. But that assumption might not represent weekends, when people's schedules tend to vary. To take a closer look, I used the next two code blocks to check out activity levels at different times of day, from Sunday through Saturday.

Looking at the summaries, it's clear that step counts are lower at night, ~21 steps on average‚Äîwhich makes sense since most peopole are asleep during that time. To get a better idea of activity levels throughout the day, I decided to focus on calculating the average steps and calories burned by time of day.

The following code creates a bar graph that represents the average calories burned and steps taken each day of the week, based on the findings above. It helps visualize how both calories and steps vary across different times of the day.

I was a bit surprised to find that most users were significantly more active in the afternoon, rather than in the morning or evening. This could be a sign of Bellabeat‚Äôs target audience‚Äîpossibly individuals who don‚Äôt follow a typical 9-to-5 schedule or who have more physically demanding jobs. Of course, drawing solid conclusions would require more data than we currently have access to, but it‚Äôs something worth considering for future research. It wasn‚Äôt surprising to see that activity levels in the morning and evening were relatively the same. As expected, nighttime was when users were the least active.

First, I analyzed how frequently users engaged with their smart devices (though the specific device types remain unknown). My goal was to understand how many Bellabeat users were consistently using their devices versus those who hardly used them. This could give a better sense of how engaged users are overall.

The results show that people who sleep more tend to have fewer light/non-active minutes during the day‚Äîa moderately strong relationship. There‚Äôs also a slight decrease in active minutes with more sleep, but that correlation is much weaker. Overall, the negative correlations suggest that more sleep may be linked to less sedentary time. The graph above supports this, indicating that individuals who get more sleep may also be more active overall.

To dig deeper into the data, I broke it down by day of the week to compare sleep and light/non-active minutes across different days. In the code block below, I filtered the data by weekday and generated summary stats for each group. This helps show when users are getting the most‚Äîor least‚Äîengagement with their smart device. These summaries show how sleep and activity levels change throughout the week.

Looking at the graphs, it becomes clear that the start of the workweek‚ÄîMonday and Tuesday‚Äîalong with Saturday, tend to be higher across most of the graphs. In contrast, Fridays consistently show lower values, suggesting that user activity tends to slow down as the week wraps up.



# üí° Key Insights <a id="key-insights"></a>

- Users tend to average around 8,533 steps a day, which is below the recommended daily target of 10,000 steps.
- Steps and calories burned have a strong positive relationship
- Activity levels vary throughout the week, with users generally being more active at the start of the workweek (Mon/Tues). Users tend to show the lowest activity levels on Fridays.
- Users are currently averaging 6.76 hours of sleep a night, which is below the recommended 8 hours.
- Users aren‚Äôt logging their weight often, even though it‚Äôs a key part of tracking health progress. Finding simple, user-friendly ways to encourage more regular weight entries could make a big difference.
- Early in the data review process, I noticed several gaps and inconsistencies that point to possible issues with how the data is being recorded or 	collected. It's also important to keep in mind the possibility of sampling bias when interpreting the results.
- Although a few clear trends stand out, most patterns among participants are relatively subtle.

### Proposal <a id="proposal"></a> 

Users aren‚Äôt meeting the recommended daily step count, which suggests lower activity levels overall. This creates a great opportunity for Bellabeat to boost engagement through personalized step goals and fun in-app challenges. Real-time alerts, like showing how many steps are left to reach a daily goal, can help keep users motivated throughout the day. Tracking steps is especially helpful because it doesn‚Äôt require any manual input from the user, making it an easy and effective way to stay active. And since step count is closely tied to calories burned, encouraging more movement can help users stay on track with both their calorie and overall health goals. 

In addition to physical activity, sleep data shows another area where users may be falling short. On average, users are getting less than the recommended 8 hours of sleep per night. Adding features like nighttime reminders or wind-down notifications could help promote better sleep habits. Since good sleep supports weight management, energy, and overall health, it‚Äôs important to encourage users to wear their smart device while they sleep. Bellabeat could advertise a new, more comfortable design specifically made for wearing overnight. This could help collect more accurate and consistent sleep data without asking users to do anything extra (except sleep more). 

Another area for improvement is weight tracking. It‚Äôs an important metric for staying on top of health goals, but many users aren‚Äôt logging it regularly. Since Bellabeat‚Äôs current smart devices don‚Äôt appear to track weight automatically, users probably have to enter this information manually through the app, which may explain the low engagement. Introducing a smart scale that syncs with the Bellabeat app could make weight tracking easier and more convenient. The scale could automatically log weight at a set time each day, so users wouldn‚Äôt have to do anything extra‚Äîjust step on the scale. To maintain a supportive environment, the app should include a clear disclaimer emphasizing that weight tracking is meant to support overall health, not promote unhealthy diet culture. Bellabeat should aim to foster a positive, empowering experience for users, building trust and focusing on long-term wellness rather than just weight loss.

Moreover, when looking at daily activity trends, Friday stood out as the most sedentary day overall. However, most patterns in the data were subtle, with only a few strong correlations. This suggests that user activity varies quite a bit from person to person. Bellabeat should consider tailoring reminders and goals to individual user needs. For example, while Friday was generally the least active day, it wasn‚Äôt the case for everyone, so the app could focus on motivating users on their own least active days. Making the app more personalized and user-specific could go a long way in boosting engagement and helping users reach their health goals.

That said, one challenge with the data was how incomplete and unreliable it was, probably because users weren't logging their data consistently. This shows that Bellabeat needs to improve how it collects user information. It should also look for more effective ways to encourage users to log their data more regularly (as mentioned above). The goal would be to meet or outdo the standards set by similar products on the current market. Getting more users from different backgrounds and collecting more data would help reduce bias and give clearer and more helpful insights. To help keep users more engaged, Bellabeat could add a rewards system or share simple, helpful tips about health and wellness. When users understand the value of the data they‚Äôre tracking, they‚Äôre more likely to stay committed and feel more connected to their goals. In the end, the easier, more helpful, and more personalized the Bellabeat experience becomes, the more likely users are to stay engaged and motivated in their journey toward better health.

Finally, understanding the target audience more clearly could help improve Bellabeat‚Äôs overall marketing strategy. Right now, the branding and website seem to be mostly geared toward women‚Äîbut that‚Äôs just a guess. By collecting more detailed user demographics, Bellabeat could tailor its marketing and create features that better fit the needs of different user groups.
