# üßÆ SQL Queries in BigQuery <a name="sql-queries"></a>

### Hourly Data

- <span style="color:gray;">'hourlyCalories.csv'</span>  
- <span style="color:gray;">'hourlySteps.csv'</span>  
- <span style="color:gray;">'hourlyIntensities.csv'</span>  

The hourly datasets above were uploaded into BigQuery. I checked if a smooth upload was successful by using a few quick queries:

---

Successful Upload Check

<details>
<summary>Show SQL Query</summary>

{% highlight sql %}
-- Remove NULLs from calories and steps
SELECT *
FROM `bellabeat-case-study.Fitabase.hourlyCalories`
WHERE Calories IS NOT NULL;

SELECT *
FROM `bellabeat-case-study.Fitabase.hourlySteps`
WHERE StepTotal IS NOT NULL;

-- Join hourly calories and steps
SELECT *
FROM `bellabeat-case-study.Fitabase.hourlyCalories` AS calories
JOIN `bellabeat-case-study.Fitabase.hourlySteps` AS steps
  ON calories.Id = steps.Id AND calories.ActivityHour = steps.ActivityHour;
{% endhighlight %}

</details>

The resulting data file: <span style="color:gray;">'hourlyMerged.csv'</span> can now be uploaded into RStudio to be further processed.

NOTE: I reintroduced the 'merged' wordage here because that is more representative of the data (which we merged).

### Daily/Sleep Data

- <span style="color:gray;">'dailyActivity.csv'</span>  
- <span style="color:gray;">'dailyCalories.csv'</span>  
- <span style="color:gray;">'dailyIntensities.csv'</span>  
- <span style="color:gray;">'dailySteps.csv'</span>  
- <span style="color:gray;">'sleepDay.csv'</span>  

The daily datasets above were uploaded into BigQuery. Again, I quickly checked if the data was uploaded accurately using the code below:

{% highlight sql %}
-- Remove NULLs from daily and sleep
SELECT *
FROM `bellabeat-case-study.Fitabase.dailyActivity`
WHERE TotalSteps IS NOT NULL;

SELECT *
FROM `bellabeat-case-study.Fitabase.sleepDay`
WHERE TotalMinutesAsleep IS NOT NULL;
{% endhighlight %}

</details>

The resulting data file: <span style="color:gray;">'daily_Merged.csv'</span> can now be uploaded into RStudio to be further processed.

NOTE: I reintroduced the 'merged' wordage here because that is more representative of the data (which we merged).
